                <p>Despite an auspicious start to the game with a strong display and commanding possession, Kwara United succumbed to goals from Joseph Godstime in the 36th minute and Sebiu Ibrahim in the 62nd minute.</p>
                <p>Although Sadeeq Yusuf managed to salvage a goal in the dying moments of the match, it proved insufficient to salvage a draw for the home side.</p>
                <p>Head coach Tunde Sanni attributed the defeat to his players' lack of poise and inefficiency in front of goal. He reassured fans that the team would diligently address these shortcomings and exhibit improvement in forthcoming matches.</p>
