            <h1>Matthijs de Ligt endures nightmare evening as Deniz Undav shines for Germany in Nations League draw with Netherlands</h1>

                <p>Deniz Undav contributed with a goal and an assist as Germany played out an exciting 2-2 draw with the Netherlands.</p>
                <p>The hosts took just two minutes to break the deadlock as Tijjani Reijnders found the back of the net from Ryan Gravenberch's pass. The Liverpool midfielder sent a through ball from the centre circle as the German defence was caught napping. Reijnders made a solo run before scoring between Marc-Andre ter Stegen's legs.</p>
                <p>Dumfries missed the easiest chance of the match in the 15th minute when he had an open net to score from Xavi Simons' inch-perfect curling free-kick. However, the full-back failed to keep his header on target from a handshaking distance.</p>
                <p>As the game progressed, the Germans slowly started to take control and their attacking approach yielded them an equaliser in the 38th minute. New Manchester United signing Matthijs de Ligt came under pressure and mistimed his pass near the penalty box as Jamal Musiala intercepted the ball. The youngster then found Kai Havertz, who in turn sent the ball towards Pascal Gross. The Brighton star attempted a shot on goal which was saved by Bart Verbruggen, but Deniz Undav scored from the rebound.</p>
                <p>The Stuttgart forward soon provided the assist for Joshua Kimmich's strike on the stroke of half-time as Germany headed into the break with a one-goal lead.</p>
                <p>The Dutch started the second half more aggressively to restore parity in the match, while the Germans adopted a more conservative strategy. It took Ronald Koeman's side only six minutes after halftime to score a second goal as Dumfries converted a simple tap-in from Brian Brobbey's pass.</p>
                <p>Both managers introduced fresh legs in the second half in search of the winner, however, the clash eventually ended in a 2-2 draw.</p>

                <h1>THE MVP</h1>
                <p>Stuttgart's Undav was included in the starting lineup after Niclas Fullkrug picked up an injury in the team's final training session in Amsterdam ahead of the match. Fielding the German striker proved to be a successful decision from Julian Nagelsmann as he turned out to be the team's best player as he contributed with a goal and an assist.</p>                
                <h1>THE BIG LOSER</h1>
                <p>De Ligt's costly mistake in the first half allowed Germany to stage a comeback as his mis-pass was intercepted by Musiala who then initiated the move from which the visitors netted the equaliser. The United defender had a night to forget as Koeman replaced him at halftime.</p>
