            <h1>England player ratings vs Finland: Never write off Harry Kane! Three Lions captain celebrates century of caps with brilliant brace in Nations League victory</h1>

                <p>The Bayern Munich striker enjoyed an almost perfect night by firing his nation to another win under interim boss Lee Carsley</p>
                <p>Harry Kane might not have had the best European Championship, but Tuesday was his night, from start to finish. The captain was lauded by the Wembley crowd on the occasion of his 100th international cap and, with his whole family watching on, he demonstrated his true striking prowess with a finishing masterclass in the 2-0 win over Finland.</p> 
                <p>Kane thought he had scored in the first half, but his header was ruled out for offside. He kept pushing to break the deadlock, though, and after a fierce battle with Finnish goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky, he ripped the net with a thunderbolt early in the second half.</p>
                <p>Once England had deservedly taken the lead, they looked far more at ease and Kane helped himself again with a precision finish after a defence splitting pass from the majestic Trent Alexander-Arnold.</p>
                <p>Interim coach Lee Carsley has two wins from two and is staking his claim to become England boss on a permanent basis, meaning he should be able to enjoy many more Kane goals from the dugout.</p>

                <h1>Goalkeeper & Defence</h1>
                <h2>Jordan Pickford (5/10):</h2>
                <p>A passenger as Finland had no shots on target and put him under no pressure when he had the ball at his feet.</p>
                <h2>Trent-Alexander Arnold (9/10):</h2>
                <p>Given licence to roam again and his searching balls stretched the Fins throughout. His pre-assist for Kane's second was the pick of his sumptuous passes.</p>
                <h2>Ezri Konsa (6/10):</h2>
                <p>Used his strength to stop Finland's occasional attacks but was forced off after pulling up in pain for the second time.</p>
                <h2>John Stones (6/10):</h2>
                <p>Moved the ball seamlessly from defence to midfield.</p>
                <h2>Rico Lewis (7/10):</h2>
                <p>Bright in possession and played some key passes to Grealish. A strong performance, even on his weaker left side.</p>

                <h1>Midfield</h1>
                <h2>Angel Gomes (7/10):</h2>
                <p>Looked comfortable on his full international debut. His consistent passing helped England control possession while he also retrieved the ball well.</p>
                <h2>Declan Rice (6/10):</h2>
                <p>Not quite as dominant as against Ireland and a stray pass led to a dangerous Finland breakaway. But otherwise good.</p>
                <h2>Jack Grealish (7/10):</h2>
                <p>Another strong performance in a freer role, although he drifted wider when Eze came on.</p>

                <h1>Attack</h1>
                <h2>Bukayo Saka (7/10):</h2>
                <p>Consistently supplied Kane with inviting deliveries.</p>
                <h2>Harry Kane (9/10):</h2>
                <p>Remained persistent despite having a goal ruled out and being repeatedly denied by Hradecky. Burst the net with his venomous first strike before expertly picking his spot in the far corner for the second.</p>
                <h2>Anthony Gordon (8/10):</h2>
                <p>Pacey, incisive and a constant threat. What a difference it makes when you play a left winger who actually wants to play there.</p>

                    <h1>Subs & Manager</h1>
                    <h2>Levi Colwill (6/10):</h2>
                    <p>Slotted in at his favoured position of centre-back and was never troubled.</p>
                    <h2>Noni Madueke (6/10):</h2>
                    <p>Rolled the ball to Kane for the second.</p>
                    <h2>Eberechi Eze (5/10):</h2>
                    <p>Very lively but kept making the wrong decision and should have scored.</p>
                    <h2>Jarrod Bowen (N/A):</h2>
                    <p>Had some joy down the right but lacked the final pass.</p>
                    <h2>Marc Guehi (N/A):</h2>
                    <p>Had an easy ride in his 10 or so minutes on the pitch.</p>
                    <h2>Lee Carsley (7/10):</h2>
                    <p>Faced a far sterner test than Ireland and Finland's low-block caused him a headache or two, but his team kept doing what they were doing and were rewarded.</p>
