                <p>The Super Eagles dropped points for the first time in the 2025 Afcon qualifiers following a 0-0 draw with Amavubi at Amahoro Stadium on Tuesday.</p>
                <p>It was a goalless affair in this Group D contest in Kigali as Nigeria could not find the target against the hosts.</p>
                <p>Augustine Eguavoen, the interim coach of the Super Eagles had the experienced do of Kelechi Iheanacho and Alex Iwobi as unused substitutes.</p>
                <p>Again, Victor Osimhen started from the bench and could not find the back of the net as he did against Benin last week.</p>
                <p>Ademola Lookman who grabbed a brace against the Cheetahs could also not score as Nigeria fired blanks.</p>
                <p>Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper Fiacre Ntwari was outstanding for Rwanda between the sticks - making saves to keep the Super Eagles at bay</p>
                <p>Stanley Ntwari of Chippa United was also in action for Nigeria who will be disappointed after failing to take their chances.</p>

                <h1>THE BIG LOSER</h1>
                <p>While the Super Eagles are more fancied opponents than Rwanda, it was Amavubi who, however, the biggest losers of the day.</p>                
                <p>After kicking off their qualifying campaign with a 1-1 draw against Libya, Rwanda failed to pick their first set of maximum points in these qualifiers.</p>

                <h1>THE BIGGER PICTURE</h1>   
                <p>It was the first time for Nigeria to drop points in these qualifiers after starting the campaign with a 3-0 win over Benin.</p>                <p>They now have four points in Group D and that gives the Super Eagles pressure for positive results in back-to-back games against Libya in October to stay on the safe side.</p> 
                <p>Rwanda have two points and are yet to taste victory in this pool.</p>

                <p>The Super Eagles return to action in October to resume the Afcon qualifiers with back-to-back fixtures against Libya.</p>
                <p>The same international period will see Rwanda having home and away assignments against Benin.</p>
